      <p>Dear Shaaru ü§ó,<br></p>
      <p>I must start by expressing the profound admiration I hold for your impeccable manners and personality. You are the definition of true beauty, you are much more beautiful from the inside than you are from the outside. You are a person filled with love, care and affection. You fill the room with light such that every space you grace turns into a celestial dance of the northern lights. You possess a rare blend of fun and depth for life. You effortlessly captivate hearts with your infectious warmth and spirit. Your feelings are deeply rooted and your emotions are extreme. You swing extreme, you cry extreme, you laugh extreme, you talk extreme and you also burst out extreme. Perhaps the extremeness is the beauty of your nature because you also love and care in extremes. <br><br> 

Your aspirations fuelled by your determination, speak volumes of your courage and intellect. I shall pray to the almighty for fulfilment of your dreams, for I have unwavering faith in your ability to build a future for yourself. Your journey is destined for greatness, and I stand in awe of the legacy you are going to build for yourself. I believe that you will make yourself, your family and me proud. Surely, your parents must swell with pride for building a human like you.<br><br> 

Most of the beautiful things happens in a very unexpected way of serendipity, so is how we met. Though I have met you only a couple of months back, it does feel like I have known you for years. Maybe it is the Blue effect you have bought to me. You came into my life as a little beacon of warmth I never knew I was looking for.<br><br> 

Every time I have a conversation with you I wish the time bows to pause, because the time always flies with you. I slightly feel sad that we did not have enough conversations in Goa due to certain circumstances, though we all had great fun all the time. Talking to you has become one of my favourite things to do, but sadenning enough for me that we live in different cities. I really wish that we can somehow make it up for that. You are such a welcoming person that although we haven‚Äôt had enough conversations, you have made me comfortable enough that I wouldn't hesitate to show you my most vulnerable self. And I hope I would aslo be able to make you feel as comfortable.<br><br> 

Your hugs works like "kattipudi vaithiyam‚Äù, because you hug the heart out of a person and transfer your positive warmth directly into their souls making them forget everything they have been going through for that moment, you carry such a lovely aura. I count myself blessed to have found the sanctuary of your affection.<br><br> 

Whenever I like someone very badly, I immediately adopt them and add them to my family. Hence let me promise you something once and for all, you have become my family now and there is no going back from here. You can consider it as more of a kidnapping than adopting. I promise you that I will be there for you all the time even when you don‚Äôt ask for it, just like a family. Though I live in a different city, I would be only a text or call away. I promise I will lend you my ears whenever you want to vent, I promise to give you my shoulder when you want to cry, I promise to laugh with you everytime you're happy, I promise to offer guidance in moments of uncertainty, I promise to support you whenever you land in any trouble, I promise I will be there to catch you when you are about to fall, I promise to cradle your dreams with unwavering devotion, and most importantly I promise I will never ever break your heart.<br><br>

And I promise I will always love you ‚ù§Ô∏è 
</p>

<p>It feels like it‚Äôs been two weeks since the last time I saw you, while it‚Äôs only been just two days. I‚Äôm missing you a lot mone ü•π</p><br><br>

<p> You're not just merely talkative, you speak from the heart and don't worry about where to stop. Such a blissful thing it is. People talking to you get so involved they lose track of time. That's how I felt today. Three hours flew by like thirty minutes. If we were in person, I might have kept talking until my manager calls me in the morning for work ü§ó</p><br><br>
<hr style="border: 5px dashed cadetblue;"/><br>
<p>09-June-2024 : 02:56 AM</p>
<p>I have a fear within me, and even a fear of fear itself. I tend to get too attached to people too quickly. I give my all to others, which has led me to choose the wrong people in my life, causing many heartbreaks. Not everyone is like me, and not everyone can get as attached to me as I get to them. This often led to broken expectations. After many heartbreaks, I learned not to expect others to give me what I give them because that's not always possible. I've become very selective in choosing friends because when I make a friend, I make a family member for life. So, I take a lot of time to judge carefully if they won't break my heart. I always fear getting hurt by the people I trust the most, not because they would, but sometimes because of fate. I fear that my fate will end up differently. But another fear is of me doing something foolish because of my fear of getting hurt. Sometimes, when I get too attached to someone, I fear a lot and try to distance myself from them. It hurts to distance myself, but still, I do it, knowingly or unknowingly.<br>
But why do I even fear in your case? Because you have become too close and too important to me in a very short time. And with time, you'll only become more important to me. That's a fact. And the closer I get, the more I fear. Yet, in your case, I can convince myself not to fear. Because you're just like me. The more love you get from me, the more you'll give it back to me. I know you would always reassure me that it won't hurt this time. After a while, we'll understand each other's minds without even speaking. I know it will be beautiful, but at the same time, I must try my best to avoid my fears spoiling it. I always have a void of not having a friend who can give me what I can give them. But you are a very special friend to me, and I'm starting to believe that you came in my life to fill that void. No matter where life takes me in the future, I always want you to be my family member and not leave the family like someone did in the past. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.</p><br><br>

<p>Mone ü§ó<br>I'm coming to hyderabad tomorrow. I've kept it hiding from you because I want to come as a surprise. I'm pretty sure you're not checking this page. Hence my surprise would remain a surprise thankfully.</p><br><br>

<p>My love ‚ô•Ô∏è,<br><br>
For days, I have been trying to write something for you. Each time I began, my mind would get confused with so many thoughts about you, about us, about everything that we share. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs an endless reservoir of feelings and reflections inside me, making it hard to pin down exactly what to say. But today, I‚Äôve decided to try and write about how you make me feel.<br><br>
Darling, you make me feel a million things at once. Ever since you came into my life, I have started liking myself more and started giving care to myself, which in all these years I barely gave any. You know why so? Because now I feel like I don't just belong to myself, I belong to you too. I must take care of myself, at least for your sake. I feel like we have a shared responsibility on me. You have the rights to take decisions on my lifestyle. You make me feel I'm precious and I must be taken care of. I have seen  destroying myself when I was in my previous relationships. But this time I'm building myself, and you are a major reason of my life changing for good.  This is such a healthy sign. Right from the beginning I never felt any hesitance in sharing my health and my state of emotional well-being with you. You have made me feel very comfortable from beginning itself. I always thought I needed a drastic incident in my life to change myself, but you proved it wrong. I never knew all I needed to change was love. Nobody other than you have been successful in convincing me to stop smoking. People have tried their best to make me quit smoking, from demanding to emotionally blackmailing me. But you my love, you have done it like a piece of cake. It's only because of the love you carry towards me, I was able to give you rights on me and let you make decisions on my life. First you made me quit smoking, then made me reduce drinking, then convinced to start eating healthy, you gave me medicine to improve my health, you gave me a new breakfast routine, a new skincare routine, and now you are giving me new goals to make myself fit. In such a short time, you are able to bring a good change in me, and I'm really excited for what more changes you are gonna bring in the long run.<br><br>
For years I have been believing that my life is similar to Jordan. A man unlucky in love. This belief has been deeply incorporated into my mind. With every incident, this belief has been increasing and the wounds on my heart were doubling. I almost convinced myself that I can never get back the love I give out. I almost lost hope in being loved back equally. But when I saw you and got to know you, I understood the fact that you were someone like me, who would love more than they receive and will always fulfil the expectations. Back then when I understood that fact, you were not mine, you were with someone else. That made my Jordan belief stronger, I felt extremely unlucky. Every moment in Goa, I felt like god was playing with me, showing exactly what I always wanted to have but also making me realise that it's not mine. You would never know how I suffocated I felt, covering my feelings for you and behaving all cool. You say that Saarika was easy for me, but trust me I have never really tried impressing you and make you fall for me. I did what I truly felt like doing. In fact I did lesser than I wanted to because it wouldn't have been appropriate at that time. All I wanted from you when I got to know you were having a relationship back then, was just a good healthy lifelong friend. Ofcourse, what else can I expect at that time. But now, look at what I have. I have you fully. Now I feel that the god was not playing with me in Goa. He was showing me you before he could you give you to me, so that I would always be grateful. Guess what, I am actually deeply grateful now. I have gratitude for having you in my life. That's why I say I don't have any high expectations from you. Because whatever I have now, was once a big dream for me. I'll always be grateful for you coming into my life and becoming mine. You make me feel like I have deserved you from long ago, because all I ever wanted is there in you.<br><br>
You know, love in general doesn't always have to give you butterflies in the stomach and make you feel the music around all the time. Sometimes, it means calm, peace and quietness, not around you but within you. Love is not something that's felt sometimes and disappears the other time. It is a constant feeling of joy and happiness. I feel like I found such love in you and with you. So how much do I love you then? Don't ask me this. Instead. Ask my smile, whenever you talk. Ask my eyes, whenever you smile. Ask my skipped beat, whenever you hug me. Ask my flirty glare, whenever you kiss me. Ask my peace, whenever you do something for me. I have fallen in love with you, darling. Falling in love with you, is the blush that curves out my face when my whole friends group teases me by your name. Falling in love is your thought that enters my heart everyday, before the sun rays enter my room. Falling in love with you makes me feel at ease. Ease with myself and ease in general. I feel I have someone to go to, someone who has my heart. I feel like I can talk to you even in your absence. You are someone who can make me smile and happy from miles away. That's how I feel being in love with you.<br><br>
The understanding you have towards me, the way you prioritise me, and the way you wanna make my life beautiful is very mesmerising. We have always prioritised to sort our arguments before going to bed. We never let our bad days extend over the night. We have always been prioritising our peace and love. The other day at the park, when you were crying, I realised how much just my mere thoughts mean you. I was afraid of hurting you unknowingly, but you made me understand that we hurt the ones who we love the most. You took the situation in control and made me understand that it's okay to be hurt in a good way by the ones you love. If we keep figuring out and sorting out every obstacle that's gonna come to us, I think we will definitely reach to leading a good future together. We both are well aware that if we ever decide to commit, it's gonna be extremely difficult to make it happen because of the family dynamics. But before that, we shall reach the state where we strongly believe that we are the ones made for each other. When we are ready to commit, we also need to have been settled in our lives. Reaching to that point itself requires a lot of time, patience, love, fights, hurt and many more. And you know what? Despite all my fears of a relationship and the fear of family dynamics, I really wish you and I successfully work this out. I want us to happen. I'm secretly praying to god that he puts us together forever. That he helps us build a future for ourselves and helps us getting married. And yes, if we reach that state where we know we are made for each other, and when we are ready to fight for ourselves, I will for sure stand for you. I'm not someone who will backoff after travelling a long journey with you. I assure you that. I hope I make a good career for myself so that I can give my parents what I always wanted to give them and also to spend the rest of my life fearlessly loving you, fighting with you, annoying you, and always falling for you. All I want in return is for you to hold my hand forever. But again, all of it will only happen if we reach such state. And god forbid, if we couldn't reach that state for whatsoever reason, I promise that I would still have you in my life and you will always hold a special place in my heart.<br><br>
You are my happiness, my heart‚Äôs desire, my motivation, the one that makes my heart beat fast. My love, my queen, my princess, I cannot live for a minute without you in my mind. I cherish you. Whenever you are with me, I want to make you smile and laugh more, I want to make you drop the facade on your face and make you feel and express everything genuinely. I want to make you feel safe and loved with me. A girl like you with a heart of gold deserves all the good things in this life, and I am prepared to go the extra mile to deserve you even more, I know you would do the same for me, that‚Äôs a fact. When I look into your eyes, all I see is the love for me.<br><br>
I love you, a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

A glance of smile that ignited the spark bright,
A seed of love planted on the first sight.
A girl so fair with a heart so pure and true,
Little did I knew that she'd be my sacred hue.
<br><br>
A dream, a wish, a hope, and a plea,
To hold her hand forever carefree.
And now it's real like a miracle untold,
A love so deep there's more to behold.
<br><br>
No more fears and aching heart,
A love so strong for a brand new perfect start.
With you by my side I'll face the world's might,
A love so pure like a moon shining bright.
<br><br>
I'm grateful for you every single day,
You light up my world though come what may.
With hand in hand we'll face life's every test,
A love so pure we are forever blessed.

Vavee‚ù§Ô∏è,<br><br>
I‚Äôve told you countless times how much I love you, how deeply you mean to me, but today I want to express something different. I want to tell you what I feel when you're around me, what it‚Äôs like to have you by my side. 
<br><br>
It‚Äôs like the feeling a mother has when she holds her baby in her arms, it's pure, unconditional, and all encompassing. You are my baby, and I feel this overwhelming sense of love and protectiveness over you. My heart wants to shield you from everything, to hold you close and never let go. It‚Äôs as if the world pauses when I have you in my arms, and I feel this sense of complete peace, as though nothing else matters.
<br><br>
Whenever I look at you, it feels like I'm seeing something beautiful for the very first time. I could look at your face a thousand times a day, and each time it feels just as magical, just as breathtaking as it did the during the first time. Your beauty, your spirit, it never fades, it only grows in my eyes. I want to keep looking at you like that, forever, because you deserve to be adored every moment.
<br><br>
I wish I could freeze time when you‚Äôre with me. I never want those moments to end, because they are perfect. And despite all the challenges we face, the fights and the difficult moments, what stays with me are only the memories of our beautiful times together. I want you to be my second half in every manner, to do everything with you, from the simplest things like grocery shopping to the grandest adventures in some foreign countries. I dream of a peaceful, joyful life, one that we build together every single day.
<br><br>
No matter how tough my day might be, I know that when I come home and I see you, everything else fades away. Holding you, being near you, makes everything feel right again. You are my everything baby, the source of all my emotions. You are my love, my care, my happiness, my sadness, my anger, my desire, my lust and my need. Everything I am, everything I feel, it all revolves around you. 
<br><br>
I am completely yours, in every possible way. And I will love you endlessly‚ù§Ô∏è
