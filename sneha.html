      <h4>Dear Sneha</h4>
      <p>As I sit down to write this message, a surge of emotions wells up within me. I want to share something that has been buried deep within my heart, something that I've struggled with and finally found the courage to express. Our friendship means a lot to me, and I believe it's time to lay bare my thoughts and feelings.<br>

Life has led me through a roller-coaster ride of experiences, both beautiful and devastating. I used to be the person who showered love and care without hesitation, but over time, life's challenges and heartbreaks left scars that made me wary of opening up to others. After having to go through a lot of hurdles and heartbreaks in life, I have lost trust with people.The very notion of building new bonds with people and trusting them became a haunting dream to me. This struggle is not something I wear on my sleeve; instead, it's a silent battle that rages within me each day. I go through a gut wrenching pain everyday which I try not to show on my face as it makes me feel vulnerable. Thousands of thoughts about my life keep conflicting in my head every second. That's the reason I get depressed or get triggered easily. This void in me is forever.<br> 

However, among all the connections in my life at Pune, it's you both(Vicky and You) who have occupied the most special place in my heart. Though you may think I have other people(Sanchita, Ayushi etc..) who matter to me more, I have always cared more about you both. The only difference is that since you both are more close to me than anyone else, I was more afraid of being broken by you than anyone else. Hence I sometimes unintentionally ignore and turn out to be rude to you. I admit, it might seem contradictory, but it's born from a fear I have within me - a fear of getting close to those who matter the most to me and then being broken by them. This fear is not a reflection of your significance in my life, but it's just a manifestation of my own doubts and past wounds.<br>

In the very first week of internship I was very connected to you. But then whatever happened in January broke me again. I felt like a new bond(our bond) which just started to grow got doom, like a flower died even before it started to gloom. That incident left me shattered, convinced me to continue not trusting anyone. Between January and last month, every time I thought of getting close to you, I feared. I feared being heart broken again. I feared to sit with you, talk to you, eat with you, laugh with you, travel with you, and for literally everything. I always wanted to tell you a lot of things about my life, wanted to spend more quality time with you, get to know you, and show my deepest care and affection to you, but I feared every single time. If ever my actions seemed careless or my words were rude, please know that it wasn't a reflection of my true feelings. Inside, I've carried a genuine affection for you, but this fear of mine has silenced that affection, masking it with an unnecessary shield. I've always yearned to show you how much you truly mean to me, yet the fear held me back. That's the reason why I sometimes say "Sorry", because I couldn’t be my true self with you.<br>

But here's the turning point: I've embarked on a journey of healing. I've recognized that the traumas of my past are chaining me, preventing me from truly living and experiencing the love and connection I deeply crave. Over this past month, I've been breaking down those walls of fear, brick by brick. Perhaps you may have noticed a change in me, I have been putting efforts to be more present to give you the love you deserve from me. It's my attempt to dismantle the barriers that have kept me from fully embracing you and our friendship.<br>

I want you to know that my intentions have always been rooted in love, even if my actions suggested otherwise. As I shed the layers of fear and insecurity, I want to show you the person I used to be – the one who radiated affection, warmth, and care. I understand if the path to rebuilding trust takes time, but I am committed to making that journey. I yearn for you to witness the genuine "me," to experience the unwavering love and care that I've held within me all along for you.<br>

Please find it in your heart to forgive the mistakes, the unintentional distance, and the misunderstandings that have clouded our path. I request you to give me a chance to strengthen our bond and trust, to truly bring you into the core of my heart, where you rightfully belong. I promise you, I'm not someone who clings or imposes – I respect boundaries while nurturing connections deeply.<br>

With utmost sincerity, I apologize for any pain or confusion my actions might have caused. And from the depths of my heart, I want to say that I love you, my dear friend. To me, close friends are family, and today, I extend that family to include you. Welcome to my heart, Habibti. </p>
