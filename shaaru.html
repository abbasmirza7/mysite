      <h4>Dear Shaaru ü§ó,<br></h4>
      <p>I must start by expressing the profound admiration I hold for your impeccable manners and personality. You are the definition of true beauty, you are much more beautiful from the inside than you are from the outside. You are a person filled with love, care and affection. You fill the room with light such that every space you grace turns into a celestial dance of the northern lights. You possess a rare blend of fun and depth for life. You effortlessly captivate hearts with your infectious warmth and spirit. Your feelings are deeply rooted and your emotions are extreme. You swing extreme, you cry extreme, you laugh extreme, you talk extreme and you also burst out extreme. Perhaps the extremeness is the beauty of your nature because you also love and care in extremes. <br><br> 

Your aspirations fuelled by your determination, speak volumes of your courage and intellect. I shall pray to the almighty for fulfilment of your dreams, for I have unwavering faith in your ability to build a future for yourself. Your journey is destined for greatness, and I stand in awe of the legacy you are going to build for yourself. I believe that you will make yourself, your family and me proud. Surely, your parents must swell with pride for building a human like you.<br><br> 

Most of the beautiful things happens in a very unexpected way of serendipity, so is how we met. Though I have met you only a couple of months back, it does feel like I have known you for years. Maybe it is the Blue effect you have bought to me. You came into my life as a little beacon of warmth I never knew I was looking for.<br><br> 

Every time I have a conversation with you I wish the time bows to pause, because the time always flies with you. I slightly feel sad that we did not have enough conversations in Goa due to certain circumstances, though we all had great fun all the time. Talking to you has become one of my favourite things to do, but sadenning enough for me that we live in different cities. I really wish that we can somehow make it up for that. You are such a welcoming person that although we haven‚Äôt had enough conversations, you have made me comfortable enough that I wouldn't hesitate to show you my most vulnerable self. And I hope I would aslo be able to make you feel as comfortable.<br><br> 

Your hugs works like "kattipudi vaithiyam‚Äù, because you hug the heart out of a person and transfer your positive warmth directly into their souls making them forget everything they have been going through for that moment, you carry such a lovely aura. I count myself blessed to have found the sanctuary of your affection.<br><br> 

Whenever I like someone very badly, I immediately adopt them and add them to my family. Hence let me promise you something once and for all, you have become my family now and there is no going back from here. You can consider it as more of a kidnapping than adopting. I promise you that I will be there for you all the time even when you don‚Äôt ask for it, just like a family. Though I live in a different city, I would be only a text or call away. I promise I will lend you my ears whenever you want to vent, I promise to give you my shoulder when you want to cry, I promise to laugh with you everytime you're happy, I promise to offer guidance in moments of uncertainty, I promise to support you whenever you land in any trouble, I promise I will be there to catch you when you are about to fall, I promise to cradle your dreams with unwavering devotion, and most importantly I promise I will never ever break your heart.<br><br>

And I promise I will always love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
