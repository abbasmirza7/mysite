      <h4>Hey you two,</h4>
      <p>I've been meaning to tell you how much you mean to me. Honestly, I can't even imagine how I would survive Pune without you both. You guys have balanced out all the negativity and filled my life with that little peace I needed to stay sane in Pune. Ever since the three of us started bonding well, I've finally found that sense of belonging I was missing. Before, it felt like I was just a nomad wandering around in the city. But now I feel like I have a home.<br><br> 

Life has led me through a roller-coaster ride of experiences, both beautiful and devastating. I used to be the person who showered love and care without hesitation, but over time, life's challenges and heartbreaks left scars that made me wary of opening up to others. After having to go through a lot of hurdles and heartbreaks in life, I have lost trust with people.The very notion of building new bonds with people and trusting them became a haunting dream to me. This struggle is not something I wear on my sleeve; instead, it's a silent battle that rages within me each day. I go through a gut wrenching pain everyday which I try not to show on my face as it makes me feel vulnerable. Thousands of thoughts about my life keep conflicting in my head every second. That's the reason I get depressed or get triggered easily. I thought this void in me is forever.<br><br> 

But here's the turning point: I've embarked on a journey of healing. I've recognized that the traumas of my past are chaining me, preventing me from truly living and experiencing the love and connection I deeply crave. Over this past month, I've been breaking down those walls of fear, brick by brick. Perhaps you may have noticed a change in me, I have been putting efforts to be more present to give you the love you deserve from me. It's my attempt to dismantle the barriers that have kept me from fully embracing you and our friendship.<br><br> 

However, among all the connections in my life at Pune, you both and Vicky stays on top. You know, growing up, my mom always wished for a sister for me. She used to go on and on about how nice life would be with a sister. So, I kind of grew up manifesting the idea of having a sister, finding that sisterly connection in every female friend I had (except, of course, the ones I had a crush on – that's a whole different story!). And guess what? You two are no exception, you're like family to me.<br><br> 

No matter where life takes each of us, just know that you've got a permanent spot in my heart. I'll be that annoying yet caring big brother who's always there for you, no matter what. We have become such a good friends, thanks to Bajaj and Sharan for keeping us together. It's a bit tough to admit that we'll be saying goodbye to Sharan soon and won't have as much time together. But fingers crossed, we'll end up staying nearby. I'll be the one flying through traffic to land at your place any time, and vice versa.<br><br> 

I know this might seem like a random out-of-nowhere message, but hey, there's no need for a special occasion to let you guys know how awesome you are. Also, I'm a bit shy, so texting you from the safety of my hometown is totally my style hehe. And no need to feel pressurised to respond to this text, it's just a timely confession, read it and keep it in your heart.<br><br> 

Take care, you two. I love you guys a lot, see you soon!❤️</p>
