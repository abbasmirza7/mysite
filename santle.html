      <h4>Hey you two,</h4>
      <p>Honestly, I can't even imagine how I would survive Pune without you both. You guys have balanced out all the negativity and filled my life with that little peace I needed to stay sane in Pune. Ever since the three of us started bonding well, I've finally found that sense of belonging I was missing. Before, it felt like I was just a nomad wandering around in the city. But now I feel like I have a home. You already know how much you both mean to me but I've been meaning to tell you the reasons behind why exactly you guys mean a lot to me.<br><br> 

So, life has led me through a roller-coaster ride of experiences, both beautiful and devastating. Used to be this open book of love and care, but bam! Life hit me with its curveballs, and then my life's challenges and heartbreaks left scars that made me wary of opening up to others. After having to go through a lot of hurdles in life, I had lost trust with people.The very notion of building new bonds with people and trusting them became like a haunting dream to me. This struggle was not something I wore on my sleeve, instead, it was a silent battle that used to rage within me each day. Thousands of thoughts about my life used to keep conflicting in my head every second.<br><br> 

But then came the turning point: I've embarked on a journey of healing. I've recognized that the traumas of my past were chaining me, preventing me from truly living and experiencing the love and connection I deeply crave.​​ Turns out, I've been my own wrecking ball. Over the past few months, I've been breaking down those walls of fear, brick by brick. Perhaps a lot has changed in me, I have been putting efforts to be more present to give my people the love they deserve from me. It's my attempt to dismantle the barriers that have kept me from fully embracing you and our friendship. And I’m happy to realize that I’ve successfully recovered(almost) and am moving towards stability in my life. In this process of healing, God has sent both of you in my life. You guys entered my life right when I needed good people. Among all my Pune connections, you both and vicky are like the VIPs. Tha twas reason one.<br><br> 

Second reason is, you know, while growing up, my mom always wished for a sister for me. She used to(still does) go on and on about how nice life would be with a sister. So, I kind of grew up manifesting the idea of having a sister, finding that sisterly connection in every female friend I had (except, of course, the ones I had a crush on – that's a whole different story!). And guess what? You two are no exception, you're like family to me.<br><br> 

So my dear kanna kuttys, no matter where life takes each of us, just know that you've got a permanent spot in my heart. I'll be that annoying yet caring big brother who's always there for you, no matter what. We have become such good friends, thanks to Bajaj and Sharan for keeping us together. It's a bit tough to admit that we'll be saying goodbye to Sharan soon and won't have as much time together. But fingers crossed, we'll end up staying nearby. I'll be the one flying through traffic to land at your place any time, and vice versa.<br><br> 

I know this might seem like a random out-of-nowhere message, but hey, there's no need for a special occasion to let you guys know how awesome you are. Also, I'm a bit shy, so presenting this message to you from the safety of my hometown is totally my style hehe. And no need to feel pressured to respond to this message, it's just a timely confession, read it and keep it in your heart. This will stay on my site as long as need(until my free hosting package expires)<br><br> 

Take care, you two. I love you guys a lot, see you soon!❤️</p>
